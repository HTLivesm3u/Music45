# Deployment Fixes Applied ✅

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make Music45 ready for Vercel deployment at `https://music45.vercel.app/`

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. Recently Played Not Working (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem**: When playing a song, it wasn't appearing in the "Recently Played" section.

**Root Cause**: The `addToRecentlyPlayed()` function was saving to localStorage, but the application state wasn't being updated, so the UI never refreshed.

**Fix Applied** in `src/main.ts`:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
addToRecentlyPlayed(item);
saveRecentlyPlayed(state.recentlyPlayed); // Using stale state!

// AFTER (Fixed)
addToRecentlyPlayed(item);
state.recentlyPlayed = loadRecentlyPlayed(); // Reload fresh state
renderRecently(); // Update UI immediately
```

**Impact**: ✅ Recently played now updates immediately when you play any song

---

### 2. TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Problem**: Build was failing due to unused imports causing TS errors.

**Fixes Applied**:

#### `src/main.ts`
- ❌ Removed unused type: `Song`
- ❌ Removed unused type: `SeekEvent`
- ❌ Removed unused function: `generateQueueItemKey`
- ❌ Removed unused function: `calculateSeekPosition`
- ❌ Removed unused function: `saveRecentlyPlayed` (handled by addToRecentlyPlayed)

#### `src/services/api.ts`
- ❌ Removed unused type: `ApiResponse`
- ❌ Removed unused type: `SearchResponse`
- ✅ Kept `LyricsApiResponse` (actually used in functions)

#### `src/services/lyrics.ts`
- ✅ All imports are used, just reformatted

**Impact**: ✅ `npm run type-check` now passes without errors

---

### 3. Vite Build Configuration Issues

**Problem**: Build was failing due to incorrect configuration.

**Fixes Applied** in `vite.config.ts`:

1. **Removed Lucide Manual Chunk**
   - Lucide is loaded via CDN, not as a dependency
   - Removed `manualChunks: { 'lucide': ['lucide'] }`

2. **Changed Minifier from Terser to ESBuild**
   - Terser is an optional dependency in Vite 5+
   - ESBuild is faster and built-in
   - Changed `minify: "terser"` → `minify: "esbuild"`
   - Removed `terserOptions` config

**Impact**: ✅ `npm run build` now completes successfully
